Okay, here is a Yodaql configuration file (`cars_analysis.yql`) designed to work with your SQL schema and address the questions you provided.

This configuration assumes:

1.  Your tables exist in a DuckDB database file named `cars.db`. If using a different engine (like SQLite) or database file, change the `@Engine` and `@AttachDatabase` lines accordingly.
2.  The `TEXT` columns `mpg` and `horsepower` in `cars_data` contain valid numbers that can be cast. Helper predicates (`MpgNum`, `HorsepowerNum`) are used for casting, assuming conversion is possible.
3.  The `TEXT` column `car_makers.country` *actually contains integer IDs* that correspond to `countries.countryid` and can be implicitly or explicitly cast for joining. This is a potential schema issue, but we proceed assuming it works.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save:** Save this code as `cars_analysis.yql`.
2.  **Database:** Make sure you have a DuckDB database file named `cars.db` in the same directory (or update the path in `@AttachDatabase`), and that it contains the tables defined in your schema.
3.  **Run LogicLM:** If you have LogicLM set up, you can point it to this configuration file. It will start a web server (on port 8090 in this example) allowing you to interactively explore the data using the defined dimensions, measures, and filters.
4.  **Run Specific Queries:** To answer the specific numbered questions, you can run the corresponding top-level predicates directly using the Logica command line:
    *   `logica cars_analysis.yql run NumContinents`
    *   `logica cars_analysis.yql run CountriesPerContinent`
    *   `logica cars_analysis.yql run MinHpModel`
    *   ...and so on for the other specific predicates defined at the end of the file.
