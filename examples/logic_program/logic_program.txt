This is the Logic Info: 
  _LOGIC_INFO

This is the input schema: 
  _SCHEMA_


These are examples of logic programs based on questions:
  #Example 1
    Question-> 
          What are top popular names on westcoast?
    Logic Program -> 
          BabyNames(fact) :-
            `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`(..fact);
          NumberOfBabies(fact) = Sum(fact.number);
          Name(fact) = fact.name;
          StateIn(fact, states:) :-
            Constraint(fact.state in states);
          ConsolidatingBabyNames(numberofbabies? Aggr= NumberOfBabies(fact), name: Name(fact)) distinct :- 
            BabyNames(fact),
            StateIn(fact, states: ["WA", "OR", "CA"]);
          Report(`Name<>`: name, `NumberOfBabies<>`: numberofbabies) :- 
            ConsolidatingBabyNames(numberofbabies, name:)

  #Example 2
    Question-> 
          How many continents are there? 
    Logic Program -> 
          Report(NumberOfContinents? += 1) distinct :- continents(); 


  #Example 3
    Question->
          How many models does each car maker produce? List maker full name, id and the number. 
    Logic Program -> 
          Report(id:, fullname:, number_of_models? += 1) distinct :-
          car_makers(id:, fullname:),
          model_list(maker: id); 

  #Example 4
    Question->
          How many countries does each continent have? List the continent id, continent name and the number of countries.
    Logic Program -> 
          Report(continent_id:, continent_name:, number_of_countries? += 1) distinct :-
          continents(contid:continent_id, continent:continent_name),
          countries(continent: continent_id); 

  #Example 5
    Question->
          What is the model of the car with the smallest amount of horsepower? 
    Logic Program -> 
          GlobalMinHp() = Min{horsepower :- cars_data(horsepower:)};

          Report(model:) distinct :-
            cars_data(id: make_id, horsepower: hp_text),
            car_names(makeid: make_id, model:),
            hp_text == GlobalMinHp(); 

Provide a Logic Program for Input Schema which answers the question- _QUESTION_. The final answer should have the name of the predicate as Report. Do not include any hashtags or comments.
